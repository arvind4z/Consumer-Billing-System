# Consumer-Billing-System

"Consumer Billing System" is aimed at developing a software application
to automate the billing process in a small café. In many cafés, billing is often handled
manually, where the staff calculates the total cost of items ordered by customers using a
calculator or by hand. This manual process can be time-consuming, prone to errors, and
inefficient during peak hours when many orders are placed. To overcome these challenges,
this system is designed to provide a fast, efficient, and accurate way to manage customer
orders and generate bills.
